Docker images are built through the Docker engine by reading the instructions from a
[`Dockerfile`][docker-docs-builder].
These text based documents provide the instructions though an API similar to the Linux
operating system commands to execute commands during the build.
The [`Dockerfile` for the example image][example-Dockerfile] being used is an example of
some simple extensions of the [official Python 3.6.8 Docker image][python-docker-image].

As a very simple example of extending the example image into a new image create a `Dockerfile`
on your local machine

~~~bash
touch Dockerfile
~~~
{: .source}

and then write in it the Docker engine instructions to add [`cowsay`][cowsay] and
[`scikit-learn`][scikit-learn] to the environment

~~~yaml
# Dockerfile

# Specify the base image that we're building the image on top of
FROM matthewfeickert/intro-to-docker:latest

# Build the image as root user
USER root

# Run some bash commands to install packages
RUN apt-get -qq -y update && \
    apt-get -qq -y upgrade && \
    apt-get -qq -y install cowsay && \
    apt-get -y autoclean && \
    apt-get -y autoremove && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt-get/lists/* && \
    ln -s /usr/games/cowsay /usr/bin/cowsay
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -q scikit-learn

# This sets the default working directory when a container is launched from the image
WORKDIR /home/docker

# Run as docker user by default when the container starts up
USER docker
~~~
{: .source}

> ## Dockerfile layers (or: why all these '&&'s??)
>
>Each `RUN` command in a Dockerfile creates a new layer to the Docker image.
>In general, each layer should try to do one job and the fewer layers in an image
> the easier it is compress.
> This is why you see all these '&& \'s in the `RUN` command, so that all the shell commands will take place in a single layer.
> When trying to upload and download images on demand the smaller the size the better.
>
> Another thing to keep in mind is that each `RUN` command occurs in its own shell, so any environment variables, etc. set in one `RUN` command will not persist to the next.
{: .callout}

> ## Garbage cleanup
> Notice that the last few lines of the `RUN` command clean up and remove unneeded files that get produced during the installation process. This is important for keeping images sizes small, since files produced during each image-building layer will persist into the final image and add unnecessary bulk.
{: .callout}

> ## Don't run as `root`
>
>By default Docker containers will run as `root`. This is a bad idea and a security concern.
>Instead, setup a default user (like `docker` in the example) and if needed give the user
>greater privileges.
{: .callout}

Then [`build`][docker-docs-build] an image from the `Dockerfile` and tag it with a human
readable name

~~~bash
docker build -f Dockerfile -t extend-example:latest .
~~~
{: .source}

You can now run the image as a container and verify for yourself that your additions exist

~~~bash
docker run --rm -it extend-example:latest /bin/bash
which cowsay
cowsay "Hello from Docker"
pip list | grep scikit
python3 -c "import sklearn as sk; print(sk)"
~~~
{: .source}

~~~
/usr/bin/cowsay

{: .output}

## Tags

In the examples so far the built image has been tagged with a single tag (e.g. `latest`).
However, tags are simply arbitrary labels meant to help identify images and images can
have multiple tags.
New tags can be specified in the `docker build` command by giving the `-t` flag multiple
times or they can be specified after an image is built by using
[`docker tag`][docker-docs-tag].

~~~bash
docker tag <SOURCE_IMAGE[:TAG]> <TARGET_IMAGE[:TAG]>
~~~
{: .source}

{: .callout}

## `COPY`

Docker also gives you the ability to copy external files into a Docker image during the
build with the [`COPY`][docker-docs-COPY] Dockerfile command.
Which allows copying a target file from a host file system into the Docker image
file system

~~~yaml
COPY <path on host> <path in Docker image>
~~~
{: .source}

For example, if there is a file called `install_python_deps.sh` in the same directory as
the build is executed from

~~~bash
touch install_python_deps.sh
~~~
{: .source}

with contents

~~~bash
cat install_python_deps.sh
~~~
{: .source}

~~~
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -e

pip install --upgrade --no-cache-dir pip setuptools wheel
pip install --no-cache-dir -q scikit-learn
~~~
{: .output}

then this could be copied into the Docker image of the previous example during the build
and then used (and then removed as it is no longer needed).

Create a new file called `Dockerfile.copy`:

~~~bash
touch Dockerfile.copy
~~~
{: .source}

and fill it with a modified version of the above Dockerfile, where we now copy `install_python_deps.sh` from the local working directory into the container and use it to install the specified python dependencies:

~~~yaml
# Dockerfile.copy
FROM matthewfeickert/intro-to-docker:latest
USER root
RUN apt-get -qq -y update && \
    apt-get -qq -y upgrade && \
    apt-get -qq -y install cowsay && \
    apt-get -y autoclean && \
    apt-get -y autoremove && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt-get/lists/* && \
    ln -s /usr/games/cowsay /usr/bin/cowsay
COPY install_python_deps.sh install_python_deps.sh
RUN bash install_python_deps.sh && \
    rm install_python_deps.sh
WORKDIR /home/data
USER docker
~~~
{: .source}

~~~bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.copy -t copy-example:latest .
~~~
{: .source}

For very complex scripts or files that are on some remote, `COPY` offers a straightforward
way to bring them into the Docker build.
